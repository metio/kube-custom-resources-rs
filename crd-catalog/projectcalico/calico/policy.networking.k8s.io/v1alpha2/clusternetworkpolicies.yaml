Policies\ndefined in this tier are used to set cluster-wide security rules\nthat cannot be overridden in the other tiers. If Admin tier has\nmade a final decision (Accept or Deny) on a connection, then no\nfurther evaluation is done.\n\nNetworkPolicy tier is the tier for the namespaced v1.NetworkPolicy.\nThese policies are intended for the application developer to describe\nthe security policy associated with their deployments inside their\nnamespace. v1.NetworkPolicy always makes a final decision for selected\npods. Further evaluation only happens for Pods not selected by a\nv1.NetworkPolicy.\n\nBaseline tier is a cluster-wide policy that can be overridden by the\nv1.NetworkPolicy. If Baseline tier has made a final decision (Accept or\nDeny) on a connection, then no further evaluation is done.\n\nIf a given connection wasn't allowed or denied by any of the tiers,\nthe default kubernetes policy is applied, which says that\nall pods can communicate with each other."
