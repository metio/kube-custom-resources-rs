Once the signer approves the\nrequest and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and\ncertificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until\ncertificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume\nsource in its spec.\n\nKubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated\nby the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt\ntimestamp.\n\nKubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath\nfield, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and\ncertificateChainPath fields.\n\nThe credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM\nentry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM\nentries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,\nsigners will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).\n\nPrefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code\ncan read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,\nyour application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide\nwith a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf\ncertificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application\nwill need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are\nconsistent.\n\nThe named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it\nissues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to\nuse the certificates it issues."
