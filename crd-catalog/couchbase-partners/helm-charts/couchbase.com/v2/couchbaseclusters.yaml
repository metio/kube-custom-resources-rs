To update an already\nmanaged data topology, you must first set it to unmanaged, make any changes, and delete\nany old resources, then follow the standard synchronization workflow.  The Operator\ncan not, and will not, ever delete, or make modifications to resource specifications\nthat are intended to be user managed, or managed by a life cycle management tool.
