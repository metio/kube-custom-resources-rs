Collections also form\nthe finest grain basis for role-based access control (RBAC) and cross-datacenter\nreplication (XDCR).  In order to be considered by the Operator, every collection group\nmust be referenced by a `CouchbaseScope` or `CouchbaseScopeGroup` resource.  Unlike the\nCouchbaseCollection resource, a collection group represents multiple collections, with\ncommon configuration parameters, to be expressed as a single resource, minimizing required\nconfiguration and Kubernetes API traffic.  It also forms the basis of Couchbase RBAC\nsecurity boundaries."
