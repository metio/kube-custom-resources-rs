In addition to the training data, the ML storage\nvolume also stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the ML\nstorage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.\n\n\nFor distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your\ntraining duration is predictable if the input data objects sizes are approximately\nthe same. SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training.\nIf the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution\nis also skewed when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming\na bottleneck in training.\n\n\nFastFile mode\n\n\nIf an algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker streams data directly from\nS3 to the container with no code changes, and provides file system access\nto the data. Users can author their training script to interact with these\nfiles as if they were stored on disk.\n\n\nFastFile mode works best when the data is read sequentially.

In addition to the training data, the ML storage\nvolume also stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the ML\nstorage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.\n\n\nFor distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your\ntraining duration is predictable if the input data objects sizes are approximately\nthe same. SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training.\nIf the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution\nis also skewed when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming\na bottleneck in training.\n\n\nFastFile mode\n\n\nIf an algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker streams data directly from\nS3 to the container with no code changes, and provides file system access\nto the data. Users can author their training script to interact with these\nfiles as if they were stored on disk.\n\n\nFastFile mode works best when the data is read sequentially. Augmented manifest\nfiles aren't supported. The startup time is lower when there are fewer files\nin the S3 bucket provided."
