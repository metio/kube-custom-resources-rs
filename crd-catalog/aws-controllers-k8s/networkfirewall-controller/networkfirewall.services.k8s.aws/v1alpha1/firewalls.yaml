Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the\nrules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet\nor modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the\nrules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is\npart of a SyncState for a firewall."
