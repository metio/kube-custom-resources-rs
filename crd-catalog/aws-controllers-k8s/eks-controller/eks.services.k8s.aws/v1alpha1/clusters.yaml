If zonal shift is enabled,\nAmazon Web Services configures zonal autoshift for the cluster.\n\nZonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC).\nARC zonal shift is designed to be a temporary measure that allows you to\nmove traffic for a resource away from an impaired AZ until the zonal shift\nexpires or you cancel it. You can extend the zonal shift if necessary.\n\nYou can start a zonal shift for an EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon Web\nServices to do it for you by enabling zonal autoshift. This shift updates\nthe flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only consider\nnetwork endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy AZs. Additionally,\nany ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for applications in your EKS cluster\nwill automatically route traffic to targets in the healthy AZs.
