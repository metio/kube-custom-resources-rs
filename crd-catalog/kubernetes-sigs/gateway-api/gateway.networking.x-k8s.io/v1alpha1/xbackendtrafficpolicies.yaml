Active requests will only be\nconsidered for the duration of the interval when calculating the retry\nbudget. Retrying the same original request multiple times within the\nretry budget interval will lead to each retry being counted towards\ncalculating the budget.\n\nConfiguring a RetryConstraint in BackendTrafficPolicy is compatible with\nHTTPRoute Retry settings for each HTTPRouteRule that targets the same\nbackend. While the HTTPRouteRule Retry stanza can specify whether a\nrequest will be retried, and the number of retry attempts each client\nmay perform, RetryConstraint helps prevent cascading failures such as\nretry storms during periods of consistent failures.\n\nAfter the retry budget has been exceeded, additional retries to the\nbackend MUST return a 503 response to the client.\n\nAdditional configurations for defining a constraint on retries MAY be\ndefined in the future.\n\nSupport: Extended"
