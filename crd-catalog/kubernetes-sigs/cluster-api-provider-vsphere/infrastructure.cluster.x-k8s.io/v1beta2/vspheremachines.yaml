Examples\nof terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the\nspec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the\nresponsible controller itself being critically misconfigured.\n\nAny transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines\ncan be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the\ncontroller's output.\n\nDeprecated: This field is deprecated and is going to be removed when support for v1beta1 will be dropped.
