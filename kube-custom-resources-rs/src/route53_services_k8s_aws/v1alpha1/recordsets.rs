    ///    record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

    ///    * Alias resource record sets: You specify the following settings: You
    ///    set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an alias resource record set in a
    ///    group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name,
    ///    and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with
